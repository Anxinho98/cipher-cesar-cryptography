# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Frequency Analysis

This project implements a Caesar cipher with modulo 256 encryption and decryption functions in Python.  
It also includes frequency analysis tools to help decrypt texts via statistical methods.

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt text using a Caesar cipher mod 256.
- Calculate absolute and relative character frequencies.
- Perform frequency analysis to guess the cipher key.
- Save encrypted, decrypted, and frequency analysis results to text files.

## Usage

- Edit the `clave` variable in the Python script to change the encryption key.
- Run the script to generate encrypted and decrypted files.
- Use frequency analysis to attempt decryption without the key.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required.
